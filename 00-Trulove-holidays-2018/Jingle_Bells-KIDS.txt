Jingle Bells G - Kids

G                                             C
Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh,
 Am                D7                   G
O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way.
                                        C
Bells on bob-tails ring, making spirits bright,
     Am           G               D7               G      D7
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight. Oh!

~Chorus~
G
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way!
C             G
O what fun it is to ride
A7                  D7
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
G
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way!
C             G
O what fun it is to ride
D7                  G
In a one-horse open sleigh
