   She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
Em        F#m/E                  Em7       F#m/E
   I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the

One   who will dance on the floor in the round

Em   F#m/E   Em7      F#m/E
             She said I am the

Em          F#m/E              Em7         F#m/E

   Billie Jean is not my lover 
Em    F#m/E              Em7         F#m/E
   She's just a girl who claims that I am the

One   but the kid is not my son
Em   F#m/E   Em7      F#m/E

   For forty days and for forty nights, law was on her side
Em         F#m/E                  Em7      F#m/E
   But who can stand when she's in demand, her schemes and her

Plans  'cause we dance on the floor in the round

Em          F#m/E              Em7          F#m/E
   She told my baby we'd danced till three; and she looked at me
Em             F#m/E        Em7       F#m/E
   Then showed a photo. A baby cries. His eyes were like

go around breaking young girls hearts   But you
C                                  Em
came and stood right by me, just a smell of sweet perfume. This
C                           B7
happened much too soon. She called me to her room. Hey
