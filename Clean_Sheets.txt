G                       B                          C
Clean sheets mean a lot to a guy who sleeps on the floor. 
G                  B                   C          
I wanted your love and a shelf on your dresser drawer. 
G                 B                      C
You tucked me in, stopped my tossin' and turnin',
G                                   B                    C
But I turned back the covers, and I saw those sheets are dirty.

E                  D                     E         C
Even though you'll never come clean, you know it's true.
G                D          B      C
Those sheets are dirty, and so are you. 

G                   B                         C
The warmth of a bed to a guy who sleeps on the floor
G                        B                    C          
Was enough to perpetuate all the lies I heard before,
G                         B                    C
And now I wanna hold you, gotta hold my pillow instead,
G                                B                     C
'Cause my pillow will never lie, or be with a stranger in my bed.

E                  D                     E         C
Even though you'll never come clean, you know it's true.
G                D          B      C
Those sheets are dirty, and so are you. 

B                      C                 G
Where's the love I was lookin' for? It's out the door. 
B                 C                    G
I'm afraid to see you anymore, so it's back on the floor,
B                       C
'Cause those sheets are dirty.

G                     B            C
Woke up this mornin', alone on the floor,
G                                 B                  C
Thinkin' about those clean sheets and the way it was before. 
G                              B                 C
When I looked in the mirror, I saw your face and thought of the past, 
G                                B                C
But now I know how dirty you are-took my fist and smashed the glass!

E                  D                     E         C
Even though you'll never come clean, you know it's true.
G                D          B      C
Those sheets are dirty, and so are you. 

E                  D                     E         C
Even though you'll never come clean, you know it's true.
G                D          B      C
Those sheets are dirty, and so are you. 

G D B                C
    Those sheets are dirty.
G D B                C
    Those sheets are dirty.
G D B                C
    Those sheets are dirty.
