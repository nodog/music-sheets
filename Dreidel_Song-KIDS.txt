Dreidel Song - KIDS

  G
I have a little dreidel
                 D7
I made it out of clay.

And when it's dry and ready,
                   G
Oh dreidel I shall play.

Chorus:
   G
Oh dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
                 D7
I made it out of clay;

And when its dry and ready,
                     G
Then dreidel I shall play.

   G
It has a lovely body,
                       D7
With legs so short and thin.

And when it gets all tired,
                    G
It drops and then I win.

(Chorus)
