B                   A
Fell in love with a girl 
  D                       E 
I fell in love once and almost completely 
B                            A  
She's in love with the world
        D                           E 
But sometimes these feelings can be so misleading 

F#                     A
She turns and says are you alright?
         D                     E 
I said I must be fine cause my heart's still beating
F#                      A
Come and kiss me by the riverside, yeah
F#
Bobby says it's fine he don't consider it cheating now 

B               A
Red hair with a curl 
       D                           E
Mellow roll for the flavor and the eyes for peeping
B                             A
Can't keep away from the girl 
          D                         E
These two sides of my brain need to have a meeting 

F#                A
Can't think of anything to do, yeah
   D                         E
My left brain knows that all love is fleeting 
F#                     A
She's just looking for something new, yeah
F#
I said it once before but it bears repeating now
