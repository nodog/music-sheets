Fox on the Run

G   D   Am  C

--- chorus ---
    G                 D            Am          C
She walks through the corn leading down to the river
    Am              D           C           G
Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
G   G
    G            D          Am             C
She took all the love tha a poor boy could give her
    Am         D          C          G
And left me to die like a fox on the run
G   G   G   G
       C                                   G
Like a fox, like a fox, like a fox, on the run

--- verse 1 ---
     C         G         D              G
Now, everybody knows the reason for the fall,
     C             G           A7         D
When woman tempted man down in paradise's hall.
     C             G               D             G
This woman tempted me alright; she took me for a ride.
C             G          D               G
Like a lonely fox, now I need a place to hide.

--- repeat chorus ---
--- verse 2 ---
      C                G       D           G
We'll drink a glass of wine to fortify our souls.
      C              G         A7                 D
We'll talk about the world and friends we used to know.
  C               G         D             G
I see a string of women who put me on the floor.
    C              G            D                G
The game is nearly over and the hounds are at my door.

--- repeat chorus ---
       C
Like a fox, like a fox, like a fox, ...
       D                                   G
Like a fox, like a fox, like a fox, on the run
