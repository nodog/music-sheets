Am7                              Dm7
Once there was a way to get back homeward 
G7                               C
Once there was a way to get back home 
Em           Am             Dm
Sleep pretty darling do not cry 
G7                     C
And I will sing a lullaby 

C      F                  C
Golden slumbers fill your eyes 
C       F                 C
Smiles awake you when you rise 
Em           Am             Dm
Sleep pretty darling do not cry 
G7                     C
And I will sing a lullaby 

Am7                              Dm7
Once there was a way to get back homeward 
G7                               C
Once there was a way to get back home 
Em           Am             Dm
Sleep pretty darling do not cry 
G7                     C
And I will sing a lullaby
