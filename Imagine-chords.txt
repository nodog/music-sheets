Imagine by John Lennon

C       Cmaj7  F
C       Cmaj7  F
C             Cmaj7       F
Imagine there's no heaven
C            Cmaj7   F
It's easy if you try
C      Cmaj7   F
No hell below us
C        Cmaj7  F
Above us only sky
F       F/E        F/D   F/C
Imagine all the people
G               G7
Living for to - day

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

(chorus)
F       G         C        E  
You may say I'm a dreamer
F       G              C    E 
But I'm not the only one
F           G          C       E 
I hope some day you'll join us
F       G          C
And the world will be as one

Imagine no posses - sions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will live as one
Imagine all the people
