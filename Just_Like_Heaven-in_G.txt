G D Amin C - bass and drums only (2x)
G D Amin C (6x)

 G               D
"Show me how you do that trick
    Amin              C
The one that makes me scream" she said
     G                 D
"The one that makes me laugh" she said
    Amin            C
And threw her arms around my neck
 G               D
"Show me how you do it
      Amin          C
And I promise you I promise that
           G                D
I'll run away with you
          Amin              C
I'll run away with you"

G D Amin C (4x)

G                D 
Spinning on that dizzy edge
  Amin                C
I kissed her face and kissed her head
    G                   D
And dreamed of all the different ways 
       Amin            C
That I had to make her glow
G               D    
"Why are you so far away?" 
    Amin                C
she said "Why won't you ever know 
            G            D
that I'm in love with you
            Amin           C
That I'm in love with you"

Lost and lonely
Em
You

Strange as angels
C
Dancing in the deepest oceans

Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream

G D Amin C (4x)

G                  D
Daylight licked me into shape
  Amin             C
I must have been asleep for days
    G              D
And moving lips to breathe her name
  Amin         C
I opened up my eyes
    G             D
And found myself alone alone
 Amin         C
Alone above a raging sea
     G              D
That stole the only girl I loved
    Amin               C
And drowned her deep inside of me

Em
You
F
Soft and only
Em
You
F
Lost and lonely
Em
You
F                   C
Just like heaven
