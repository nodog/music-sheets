       C              G                 Am          F
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
C                 G              F  Em  Dm  C
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
       C              G                 Am          F
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
C                 G              F  Em  Dm  C
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
       C              G                 Am          F
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
C                 G              F  Em  Dm  C
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

       C              G                 Am          F
And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
C                 G              F  Em  Dm  C
There will be an answer, let it be
       C              G                 Am          F
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
C                 G              F  Em  Dm  C
There will be an answer, let it be
       C              G                 Am          F
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
C                 G              F  Em  Dm  C
Yeah, There will be an answer, let it be
       C              G                 Am          F
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
C                 G              F  Em  Dm  C
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
