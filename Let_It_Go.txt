    Fm                      Db
The snow blows white on the mountain tonight
      Eb              Bbm
Not a footprint to be seen
  Fm            Db
A kingdom of isolation
       Eb                 Bbm
And it looks like I'm the queen.

Fm            Db
  The wind is howling
          Eb               Bbm
Like this swirling storm inside.
Fm                 Eb
  Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I
Fm         Bbm
  tried.

Eb               Eb
  Don't let them in, don't let them see.
Db                     Db
  Be the good girl you always have to be.
Eb                     Eb
  Conceal, don't feel, don't let them
Db    Db
know.
     Db              Db
Well now they know.

Let it go.  Let it go.

Can't hold it back anymore.

Let it go.  Let it go.

Turn away and slam the door.

I don't care

what they're going to say.

Fm                      Db
  It's funny how some distance
      Eb              Bbm
Makes everything seem small.
        Fm                 Eb
And the fears that once controlled me
      Fm           Bbm
Can't get to me at all.



Eb                 Eb
  It's time to see   what I can do.
Db           Db
  To test the   limits and break
Eb                    Eb
through. No right, no wrong, no rules for me.
Db     Db    Db
  I'm free.

       Ab          Eb
Let it go.  Let it go.
     Fm                    Db
I am one with the wind and sky.
       Ab          Eb
Let it go.  Let it go.
       Fm           Db
You'll never see my cry.

Ab     Eb
Here I stand.
    Fm        Db
And here I'll stay.
        Cm         B
Let the storm rage on.

  My power flurries through the

air into the ground.
Db7          Db7
  My soul is spiraling
   Db7             Db7
in frozen fractals all around.
Eb7               Eb7
  And one thought crystalizes

like an icy blast.
Fm          Db
  I'm never going back,
    Eb             Bbm    Db
the past is in the past.
