Lighthouse Keeper by Erika Elgen

G                 C
I want to marry a lighthouse keeper
    D             G
And keep him company
G                 C
I want to marry a lighthouse keeper
    Am                      D
And live by the side of the sea
     G                       Bm
I'll polish his lamps by the light of day
   G                  C
So ships at night can find their way
G                 C
I want to marry a lighthouse keeper
D              G
Won't that be okay?

C
We'll take walks along the moonlit bay
      Bm
Maybe find a treasure, too
C
I'd love living in a lighthouse
          D
How 'bout you?

G                      C
I dream of living in a lighthouse, baby,
D            G
Every single day
G                      C
I dream of living in a lighthouse
Am                 D
A white one by the bay
   G                      Bm
So if you want to make my dreams come true
G                             C
You'll be a lighthouse keeper do
G                  C
We could live in a lighthouse
  D                G
A white one by the bay hey hey
D              G
Won't that be okay?
D                 G
Ya ti ti ti ta ta ta
