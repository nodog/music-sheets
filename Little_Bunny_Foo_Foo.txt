D                    A7
Little bunny Foo Foo hoppin' through the forest
D                              A7                 D
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head.

(spoken) And down came the good fairy, and she said:

D                      A7
"Little bunny Foo Foo, I don't wanna see you
D                              A7                 D
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head.

NC
(spoken) I'll give you 3 chances, and if you don't behave, I'm going to turn you into a goon!"

NC
(Repeat all, decreasing the number of chances until they are gone, then end with the following)

(spoken) "I gave you 3 chances. Now I'm going to turn you into a goon!"
