Em                 D
When routine bites hard,
Bm                A
And ambitions are low,
Em                   D
And resentment rides high,
Bm                 A
But emotions won't grow,
Em                     D
And we're changing our ways,
Bm               A
Taking different roads.

Then love, love will tear us apart again.

Em                    D
Why is the bedroom so cold?
Bm                         A
You've turned away on your side.
Em                D
Is my timing that flawed?
Bm                  A
Our respect runs so dry.
Em                     D
Yet there's still this appeal
Bm                          A
That we've kept through our lives.

Em                     D
Do you cry out in your sleep,
Bm                A
All my failings exposed.
Em                     D
And there's a taste in my mouth,
Bm                   A
As desperation takes hold.
Em                     D
It's that something so good
Bm                     A
Just can't function no more.
