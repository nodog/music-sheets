Sabotage - Beastie Boys


I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm a set it straight, This Watergate
I can't stand rockin when I'm in here
Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So, while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fuckin' thorn in my side
Oh my god it's a mirage
I'm tellin y'all it's sabotage

scratch solo [8 measures]

so so so
So listen up cause you can't say nuttin
You'll shut me down with the push of your button?
But you, I'm out and I'm gone
I tell you now, I keep it on and on

guitar solo [8 measures]

So what you see you might not get
And we can bet so you don't get souped yet
You're scheming on a thing and that's a mirage
I'm tryin to tell ya now, it's sabotage

scratch solo [8 measures]

silence

bass note/ bass solo [8 measures]

whooooooooooooooa [4 measures] [2 measures no vocals]
Why; our backs are now against the wall [2 measures]

Listen all a y'all it's a sabatoge
Listen all a y'all it's a sabatoge
Listen all a y'all it's a sabatoge
Listen all a y'all it's a sabatoge

I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm a set it straight, This Watergate
But I can't stand rockin when I'm in this place
Because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face
But make no mistake and switch up my channel
I'm buddy rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be it's a mirage
You're scheming on a thing that's sabotage
