E                         A
Whatever you want from me,
E                         A
whatever you want I'll do.
E                              A
Try to squeeze a drop of blood,
E                A
from a sugarcube.

E                      A
Try to be more assured,
E                          A
try to be more right there.
E                      A
Try to be less uptight,
E                    A
try to be more aware.
E                         A
Whatever you want from me,
E                            A
is what I want to do for you.
E                            A
Sweeter than a drop of blood,
E                A
from a sugarcube.

And though I like to act the part of being tough,
F#m       G#m         A    A
I crumble like a sugarcube,
B       B
for you!

squeeze a drop of blood, from a sugarcube.
