The Luckiest Girl in the Wasteland

G                         D
Annika was playing in her back yard
    G                           C
She wonderered why her cat went on guard
      G                                 C
But a shambler was approaching, And she needed no coaching
         D7                  G
Into her house she went with door barred

From a horde she ran to say later
On the trainstation up escalator
At the top she fell down, Swapped the circuit around
The receding zombies decided they hate her

Garlic does nothing against the moaners
So she normally left it aloners
Once in high concentration, They showed hesitation
Her pesto prevents organ donors

While playing on an old ferris wheel
A pack of the rotted needed a meal
Being quite agile, She unhooked the axle
And rolled away on a framework of steel

          C                    Bm7
She's the luckiest girl in the Wasteland
          C                      G
She gets away with way more than you can
      C                          Bm7
Let's state it so it's well understood
     D                       G
It's better to be lucky than good
G G

At a donut shop she wanted a snack
When two undead came in the back
Powdered sugar did blind 'em, And she snuck 'round behind 'em
Tasty treats foiled that attack

She was arts and crafting with glitter
When the wind caused it to flitter
Her eyes followed the traces, Pointing out zombie faces
And with a skip far away she did skitter

While being chased through the library stacks
She discovered an old fire ax
With one swing at a bookshelf, She dominoed herself
Out of turning into overdue snacks

At the door she heard a loud knock knock
"Who's there?" she yelled in a mock mock
The walkers said "unh", "Unh who" she responds
"Unh'd eat you except for this lock lock"

She's the luckiest girl in the Wasteland

Let's state it so it's well understood
It's better to be lucky than good

She was passing through the old wildlife park
When a twitcher labelled her a mark
But out of nowhere a penguin, Decided to eat him
Guess the pickin's had gotten quite stark

Anni has a cat friend named Noe
With alarms often quite showy
If Noe's hair stands on end, It's time to defend
Or run as fast as your little feet can go-e

CHORUS
She's the luckiest girl in the Wasteland
She gets away with way more than you can
Let's state it so it's well understood
It's better to be lucky than good

She's the luckiest girl in the Wasteland
She gets away with way more than you can
Let's state it so there's no debate
It's even better to be lucky than great
D G
