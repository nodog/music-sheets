The Twelve Days of Christmas

       G              Em
On the twelfth day of Christmas,
   Am        D       G
My true love sent to me
D
Twelve drummers drumming,
D
Eleven pipers piping,
D
Ten lords a-leaping,
D
Nine ladies dancing,
D
Eight maids a-milking,
D
Seven swans a-swimming,
D
Six geese a-laying,
G    A    D
Five gold rings,
G
Four colly birds,
C
Three French hens,
A          D
Two turtle doves,
      G/B C     G/D  D    G
And a partridge in a pear tree!
