Time is a River

Now I ain't really ever met someone who was truly evil
But I sure have seen folks with a strange definition of good

Backwoods in the Wasteland
Big E was scoutin' around
Ran across a situation
With a whole lotta mess goin' down
Turns out for some ducats
Some scum had started a scam
Snatchin' up the weak and weary
From and off guard neighboring clan

These feathermessers were infectin'
Their captives then lettin' 'em go
Release a pack back on their neighbors
Then there'd be havoc for sho'
Then low smurfs offered protection
From the weakened twitchers they had dropped
But always for copious coin
Clearly this had to be stopped

Time is a river
And thank god
'Cause it washes the stank away
This situation needs a spray down from the funky firehose
Time is a river
And thank god
'Cause it washes the stank away
These circumstances are certainly malodorous

Brother Alaric and trusty Everett
Returned to deal with the rats
Sleeping darts took out the guards
To the prison and the crew habitats
After releasing those in bondage
They opened up the bunkhouse doors
Next the gate of zombie pens
And watched as nature took it's course

Time is a river
And thank god
'Cause it washes the stank away
It's gonna take way more than perfume to cover that up
Time is a river
And thank god
'Cause it washes the stank away
I am pretty sure there is something rotten in the state of Denmark

Well the lowlife got what was coming
Our champions had saved the day
A bit of sunshine in the Wasteland
Now a slightly more survivable place
Many years later where this went down
The woods returned to their natural state
Wiping away the heinous memories
Not one whiff of that ol' funky taint

Time is a river
And thank god
'Cause it washes the stank away
But my that was pungent
Time is a river
And thank god
'Cause it washes the stank away
That stench was worse than the rotted themselves
