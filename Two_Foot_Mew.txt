Two Foot Mew   128 bpm

I'm two foot one and I done begun hun'
I'm a killer cat chosen one in a million
All teeth talon and the fight in the kitten
Heck I can slow down time; they call it the quicken

I'm two foot two and you can call me Beru
Make no hullabaloo, it's zombies that I pursue
Walkin the Wasteland is the lot that I drew
Takin down the undead with their death overdue

I'm two foot three and I'm ridin' with Z
She's a deadly crafty kitty and I'm glad we're a we.
She helped me wiggle free being crushed by a tree
It's a beastly bag of tricks she got with this emcee

I'm two foot four and we're harder than hardcore
Explore this eyesore, stomp undead like a dinosaur
Speaking of forgotten lore, I implore
Walkers can we ignore? Quoth the kitten, nevermore

It's the Two Foot Mew
Never untrue
What've you been through?
Tell us how you do
