D                             C#
I'm two foot one and I done begun hun'
F#                               C#
I'm a killer cat chosen one in a million
D                             E
All teeth talon and the fight in the kitten
F#                                      C#
I can even slow down time; they call it the quicken

I'm two foot two and you can call me Beru
Make no hullabaloo, it's zombies that I pursue
Walkin the Wasteland is the lot that I drew
Takin down the rotted with their death overdue

I'm two foot three and I'm ridin' with Z
She's a deadly crafty kitty and I'm glad we're a we.
She helped me wiggle free being crushed by a tree
It's a beastly bag of tricks she got with this emcee

I'm two foot four and we're harder than hardcore
Explore this eyesore, stomp undead like a dinosaur
Speaking of forgotten lore, I implore
Moaners can we ignore? Quoth the kitten, nevermore

I'm two foot five and only fully alive
When we're killing off the creatures that are dead and revive.
Giving you a deeper dive, I strive to contrive
Methods to deprive twitchers' right to survive

I'm two foot six and here's the basics
I cover Z's back with my claws-in-the-flesh tricks
My kinetics break statistics and physics
My acrobatic antics drop the zed in the styx

I'm two foot seven and you can take as a given
That we lay a nasty trap called the flesh eater oven
First I head up in a warren then I cry like a munchkin
The walkers come a runnin' like it's some kind of luncheon

I'm two foot eight and they fell for the bait
We wait til the building's full as it can accommodate.
Activate the quicken, then I head for the gate.
Z ignites the nitrate, animated incinerate.

I'm two foot nine, and I shall now opine
That I come from a clan with a remarkable bloodline.
Mostly feline, undeniably vulpine,
Serpentine, Frankenstein, and a dash of Einstein.

I'm two foot ten but let's combine with eleven,
Cos I gotta tell the tale of how my kin were begotten.
Created in a lab to be used as a weapon,
Genetically selected to be some kinda hellion.

Built to reason then fight like a demon
Our creators had agenda, but we granted them treason.
One thing was forgotten when dealing with kitten.
As to following orders, no less cares could be given.

I'm two foot twelve and shall I now delve
Into the bigger question that concerns you as well?
Can I still look out for others in this world gone to hell?
Just watch me cutting zombies. Now I bid you farewell.
