Two Foot Mew   128 bpm

I'm two foot one and I done begun hun'
I'm a killer cat chosen one in a million
All teeth talon and the fight in the kitten
I can even slow down time; they call it the quicken

I'm two foot two and you can call me Beru
Make no hullabaloo, it's zombies that I pursue
Walkin the Wasteland is the lot that I drew
Takin down the rotted with their death overdue

I'm two foot three and I'm ridin' with Z
She's a deadly crafty kitty and I'm glad we're a we.
She helped me wiggle free being crushed by a tree
It's a beastly bag of tricks she got with this emcee

I'm two foot four and we're harder than hardcore
Explore this eyesore, stomp undead like a dinosaur
Speaking of forgotten lore, I implore
Moaners can we ignore? Quoth the kitten, nevermore

It's the Two Foot Mew
Never untrue
What've you been through?
Tell us Two Foot Mew

I'm two foot five and only fully alive
When we're killing off the creatures that are dead and revive.
Giving you a deeper dive, I strive to contrive
Methods to deprive walkers' right to survive

I'm two foot six and here's the basics
I cover Z's back with my claws-in-the-flesh tricks
My kinetics break statistics and physics
My acrobatic antics drop the zed in the styx

I'm two foot seven and you can take as a given
That we lay a nasty trap called the flesh eater oven
First I head up in a warren then I cry like a munchkin
The walkers come a runnin' like it's some kind of luncheon

I'm two foot eight and they fell for the bait
We wait til the building's full as it can accommodate.
Activate the quicken, then I head for the gate.
Z ignites the nitrate, animated incinerate.

It's the Two Foot Mew
Never untrue
What've you been through?
Tell us Two Foot Mew
