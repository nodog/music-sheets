An animated from a car But it was all alone

              D                   A
There'd been rumor of a way To destroy all walking dead
        G                             A
But she knew those were vain ideas in academic heads

        D                          A
But she paired up with a liar Who played on her good faith
    G                                 D
And almost got them bitten Collecting venom from a wraith

       D                     A
He had mistepped in deed And lost his game as gambler
    G                                        A
