She's the daughter of a dancer and survivor of War Z
    A                              B
Her mother was the doctor teaching her anatomy

    E                          B
She hadn't even kissed a man before she struck one down
A                             E
After the disease had put him 6 feet undergound

   E                           B
Surviving in the wasteland was rude reality
A                          B
neutralizing undead became life's necessity

          E                             B
With her trusty sword, k'tan and her companion cat, Beru
    A                                 E
She guards the Concord Wastelands protecting me and you.

        E                                 B
She was walking east to Areshton when she heard the wailing moan
    A                      B
An animated from a car but it was all alone

   E                                 B
Or so it seemed when she saw it was missing its left arm
    A                              E
But more heard the cry and ran to join from a nearby farm

      E                  B
But k'tan swung fast and steel sliced true
    A                              B
Dismembering the diseased until remained just a few

    E                              B
One grabbed her right shoulder and dove in for the bite
      A                         E
but Beru struck it fiercely and finished up that fight

              E                   B
There'd been rumor of a way to destroy all walking dead
        A                             B
But she knew those were vain ideas in academic heads

        E                          B
But she paired up with a liar who played on her good faith
    A                                 E
And almost got them bitten collecting venom from a wraith

       E                     B
He had mistepped in deed and lost his game as gambler
    A                                        B
And soon would become the hated, a wandering soul, a shambler

    E                                B
The weight she took upon herself was more than she had feared
    A                          E
She did what she had to do and cried a single tear

--- E
